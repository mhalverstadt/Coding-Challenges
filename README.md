## Optimizations
I first try and solve a problem by any means, then I go back and refactor to make it more readable and as optimized.

## Lessons Learned:
If you don't practice what you have learned you are at risk of forgetting it. These problems help me keep on top of my own education and really embed new methods into my memory.
