// Run-length encoding (RLE) is a very simple form of data compression in which runs of data (that is, sequences in which the same data value occurs in many consecutive data elements) are stored as a single data value and count, rather than as the original run. Wikipedia

// Task
// Your task is to write such a run-length encoding. For a given string, return a list (or array) of pairs (or arrays) [ (i1, s1), (i2, s2), â€¦, (in, sn) ], such that one can reconstruct the original string by replicating the character sx ix times and concatening all those strings. Your run-length encoding should be minimal, ie. for all i the values si and si+1 should differ.

// Examples
// As the article states, RLE is a very simple form of data compression. It's only suitable for runs of data, as one can see in the following example:

// runLengthEncoding("hello world!")
//  //=>      [[1,'h'], [1,'e'], [2,'l'], [1,'o'], [1,' '], [1,'w'], [1,'o'], [1,'r'], [1,'l'], [1,'d'], [1,'!']]
// It's very effective if the same data value occurs in many consecutive data elements:

// runLengthEncoding("aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaabbb")
//  // => [[34,'a'], [3,'b']]

//mine:
var runLengthEncoding = function(str){
  let result = []
  for(let i = 0; i < str.length; i++){
    let num = 1
    for(let j = i + 1; j < str.length; j++){
      if(str[i] === str[j]){
        num++
      }else{
        break;
      }
    }
    result.push([num, str[i]])
    if(num !== 1){
      i += num - 1
    }
  }
  return result
}

//top solution:
function runLengthEncoding(str) {
  var arr = [],
      counter = 1;

  for (var i = 0; i < str.length; i++) {
      if (str[i] === str[i + 1]) {
          counter++;
      } else {
          arr.push([counter, str[i]]);
          counter = 1;
      }
  }

  return arr;
}
