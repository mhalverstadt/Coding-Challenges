# The goal is to create a function of two inputs number and power, that "raises" the number up to power (ie multiplies number by itself power times).

# Examples
# number_to_pwr(3, 2)  # -> 9 ( = 3 * 3 )
# number_to_pwr(2, 3)  # -> 8 ( = 2 * 2 * 2 )
# number_to_pwr(10, 6) # -> 1000000
# Note: math.pow and some others math functions are disabled on final tests.

#mine and top solution:
def number_to_pwr(number, p): 
    result = 1
    for _ in range(p): 
        result *= number
    return result
